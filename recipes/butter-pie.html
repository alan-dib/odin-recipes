        <h2>What you will need:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Flour</strong>
            <p>
                <em>This flaky pie crust recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</em>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong> Salt </strong>
            <em>
                <p> A pinch of salt enhances the flavor and promotes a tender, moist crust.</p>
            </em>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Butter</strong>
            <em>
                <p>Cold butter adds rich flavor and creates steam as it melts, <br>
                ensuring a perfectly flaky finished product.</p>
            </em>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Water</strong>

            <em>
                <p>Cold water acts as a binding agent which holds the dry ingredients together. <br>
                It also contributes to the flakiness of the crust as it evaporates.</p>
            </em>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Makes a Pie Crust Flaky?</h2>

    <p>When it comes to making a flaky pie crust, it's all about the fat <br>
    (in this case, butter). The fat works in two ways:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <em>
                <p>It coats the flour, preventing it from absorbing the liquid and creating gluten. <br>
                 Too much gluten produces a dense, chewy crust.</p>
            </em>
        </li>

        <li>
            <em>
                As the fat melts during baking, it leaves air pockets in the dough. <br>
                The pockets fill with steam and expand, creating layers of flaky pastry crust.
            </em>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>For the flakiest crust, make sure your ingredients are as cold as possible to prevent the fat from melting before <br>
    it makes it to the oven. It also helps to work with cold hands and, if possible, a marble rolling pin and cutting board.</p>
