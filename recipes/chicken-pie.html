    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong> Chicken </strong>
            <br> 
            <em>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are <br>
            ideal for making classic chicken pot pie.</em>
        </li>
        
        <p>
            <li>
            <Strong>Vegetables</Strong>
            <br>
            <em>This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: <br> 
            peas, carrots, onions, and celery. <br> 
            You could toss in some mushrooms or green peppers <br> 
            if you want to incorporate more veggies.</em>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                <strong>Butter and Flour</strong>
                <br>
                <em>The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with <br>                  
                butter and all-purpose flour.</em>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                <strong>Seasonings</strong>
                <em>
                    Achieve the perfect cozy flavor with salt, pepper, <br>
                    and celery seed. Of course, you can add more seasonings to <br>
                    suit your taste.
                </em>
            </li>

                    Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavor <br>
                    and help create a smooth and decadent <br>
                    chicken pot pie filling consistency.
                </em>
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Pie Crusts</strong>
                <em>
                    You'll need two unbaked pie crusts. If you opt for the homemade route, <br>
                    you can't go wrong with our 

                    <a href="" target="_blank">Butter   Flaky Pie</a>

    <ol>
        <p>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the Filling</strong>

                <p> Boil the cubed chicken with the carrots, peas, and celery for about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. <br>
                Cook the onions in butter until they're translucent, then stir in the flour and seasonings. <br>
                Add the chicken broth and milk and simmer until the filling is thick.</p>
            </li>
        </p>

        <p>
            <li>
                <strong>Fill and Bake the Pie</strong>
                <p>
                    Place the chicken-vegetable mixture in an unbaked pie crust. Pour the chicken broth mixture over it. <br>
                    Cover with the top crust, seal the edges, and cut slits in the top to allow the steam to escape. <br>
                    Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
                </p>
